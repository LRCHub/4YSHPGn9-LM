If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
We'll have more fun baby all way down the line
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
There ain't no need to tarry let's start out tonight
We'll have fun oh boy oh boy and we'll do it right
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' make every spot in town
We'll go to the every spot and leave all gold around
If you run short of money I'll run short of time
If you've got no more money honey I've got no more time
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
We'll go honky tonkin' and we'll have a time
Bring along your Cadillac leave my old wreck behind
If you've got the money honey I've got the time
